                <p className="mb-4">
                    Sellaids operates independently and is not officially affiliated with any of the brands whose products are sold on the platform unless expressly stated otherwise. All brand names and trademarks are the property of their respective owners. Sellers on the platform are required to provide genuine products and Sellaids performs due diligence to verify authenticity but cannot guarantee brand involvement or warranties.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-heading text-black mt-6 mb-2">3. Seller's Responsibilities</h2>

                <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">3.1 Ownership and Legality</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    By listing an item for sale, the seller warrants that they have full legal rights to the item, that the item is genuine and that its sale does not infringe any intellectual property or violate any applicable laws. It is the seller’s responsibility to ensure that they possess a clear title to the goods and that the items conform to all descriptions provided.
                </p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">3.2 Product Inspection</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    All items listed for sale on Sellaids must undergo a mandatory physical verification process. This is to confirm that the product is authentic, in the condition described by the seller and suitable for sale on the platform. If any item fails the verification process, it will be returned to the seller and the seller will be responsible for all associated return shipping costs.
                </p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">3.3 Claim Period for Returned Items</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    If an item is returned or fails verification, the seller must claim the product within a 14 day window. Failure to claim the item within this period will result in Sellaids no longer being responsible for storing the item and Sellaids can use the product anywhere they want. The product may be discarded or otherwise disposed of and no compensation will be provided to the seller.
                </p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">3.4 Documentation</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Sellers are required to provide any documentation related to the product, including original receipts, packaging, authenticity certificates or any other proof that can help verify the legitimacy and origin of the item. Providing proper documentation may increase the value and sale potential of the product.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    Any product which is above the amount of 10000, consignment will be signed between the seller and the company for pick up and verification/authentication as soon as it comes for listing and if that product is authentic the product will be listed and either returned back on seller’s expense or will be under consignment with the company for a period of 3 months.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    In case the seller wants to extend the consignment to further time they need to inform the company for extending the period. In case the product is not authentic it will be returned back to the seller on the seller’s expenses and Rs. 1000 will be charged as a handling fee.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-heading text-black mt-6 mb-2">4. Buyer’s Responsibility</h2>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">

                <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">5.1 Product Authenticity</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Sellaids takes every precaution to verify the authenticity of items listed for sale. However, due to the nature of secondhand/preloved goods, buyers should exercise their own judgment when making a purchase. If a product fails our physical verification process after purchase, the buyer will be informed and will receive a full refund.
                </p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">5.2 Condition of Products</h3>
                <p className="mb-2">We provide descriptions of preloved product conditions based on a standardized grading system. These categories include:</p>

                </ul>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    By purchasing an item, buyers acknowledge that the product may have been used and understand the condition as described in the listing.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-2xl font-heading text-black mt-6 mb-2">6. Commissions and Fees</h2>

                </p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">6.2 Payment Terms for Sellers</h3>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    Sellers are responsible for covering shipping costs when returning items that have failed verification.

In the case of a product sale, shipping costs are typically included in the buyer’s checkout process unless otherwise agreed.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-heading text-black mt-6 mb-2">7. Listing and Sale Process</h2>

                <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">7.1 Listing Your Products</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Once an item passes verification, it will be listed for sale on the Sellaids platform. There is no set time limit for how long a seller can keep their product listed. After a few months, sellers can consult with the Sellaids team to adjust the selling price to enhance the chances of a sale. Items may be featured in various product categories based on their condition and value.
                </p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4">7.2 Item Repairs</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    If an item listed for sale requires repairs to improve its marketability or functionality, Sellaids will coordinate the repair process on behalf of the seller. The seller will be notified of the required repairs and associated costs before proceeding. Upon the seller’s approval, the repair will be carried out by professionals and the cost will be added to the seller’s account. The seller must cover the repair expenses in full before receiving their payout from the sale of the item.
